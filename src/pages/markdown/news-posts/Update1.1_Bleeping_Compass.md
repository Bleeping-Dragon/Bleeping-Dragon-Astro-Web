There were some issues regarding material you colors. In android 11 or lower the system can not pick a color palette from the user wallpaper. So I didn't consider that, and the app crashed when entering settings page ðŸ˜…

Now a blue colored palette is provided by default ðŸ˜‰ and everything works as usual.

You can check the app here:

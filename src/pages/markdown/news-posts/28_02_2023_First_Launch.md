Hi everyone! I'm Miguel Cano, creator of the Bleeping Dragon brand.

The first app of Bleeping Dragon is about to get launched! Bleeping Compass, a compass app using the new Material You design guidelines written in Kotlin.

I'm hoping to release the first version soon, near everything is ready, I'm just waiting to get verified in the Play Store.

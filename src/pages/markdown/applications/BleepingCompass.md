# 📲App Overview
The **Bleeping Compass** app consists on a compass app built with two main principles in mind:

- Simplicity
- Cleanness

Using the new Material You design language approach, the users experience a clean and simple interface that adapts to their phone, starting in Android 12 the wallpaper theme is used to generate the color palette of the app.

The left image shows the main part of the app, a simple compass, just rotate your device to see where the "N" (the North pole) faces. Other letters are for the rest of poles.

In the navigation rail at the bottom on the screen (present in the 2 images) you can switch from the compass to the settings mode.

Inside the settings there are 2 main toggles:

- **Keep Screen On:** To keep the screen on when using the compass mode (it won't apply to the settings)

- **Show Ads:** They are left on by default, but they can be disabled with no additional costs.

Lastly there is this brand logo and a link to the site.
